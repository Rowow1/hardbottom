"""Apply the dated legal-review updates to the base citation registry.

build-law.py builds the August 2026 registry (53 entries). This module layers every later review
on top of it, from the JSON sources in tools/law-updates/<date>/. Each source file is an array of
law.json-shaped entries produced by a research pass, carrying an `axes` record of the four-axis
check. Entries whose id already exists in the registry are corrections: if they carry `replaces`,
only those fields change; otherwise every supplied field replaces the old one.

Decisions that a machine cannot make (duplicates between passes, conflicts, prose corrections that
came back as instructions rather than fields) are written out explicitly in MANUAL below, dated,
so the reasoning survives. Edit the sources or MANUAL, never data/law.json.
