# Building and deploying

How the data in `data/` was made, how to rebuild it, and how the website is published.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `index.html`, `about.html`, `404.html`, `favicon.svg`, `css/`, `js/`, `vendor/leaflet/` | The website |
| `data/` | The map's data files; sources and licences in `DATA-SOURCES.md` and `LICENSE-DATA.md` |
| `build-standalone.py` | Builds the two offline single-file copies |
| `tools/` | Derivation scripts, dated legal review passes, curated sources and parsed geometry |
| `test/smoke-test.js` | Boots the page in jsdom and checks the notice, legend, search and panels |
| `docs/` | This file, field formats (`SCHEMA.md`), the procedure for adding a rule (`ADDING-A-ZONE.md`) and the backlog |
| `.github/workflows/` | `ci.yml` runs the checks on every push; `deploy.yml` builds the `site` branch |
| `robots.txt`, `.htaccess` | Web server settings for the Hostinger deployment |

## Publishing

1. A push to `main` runs `deploy.yml`. It repeats the checks, copies the website files into `dist/`,
   builds `bottom-truth-offline.html` and `bottom-truth-offline-lite.html` into it, and commits the
   result to the `site` branch on top of the previous site commit.
2. Hostinger's Git deployment for bottomtruth.com pulls the `site` branch into `public_html`, either
   automatically through its webhook or with the Deploy button in hPanel.
3. Pushing a tag such as `v2026.10.06` also publishes the two offline copies as a GitHub release.

The offline copies are never committed to `main`. The `site` branch does carry them, so it grows by
about 21 MB each time the data changes. If it becomes large it can be reset to a single commit; the
Hostinger deployment then needs one manual redeploy.

**Launched 7 October 2026.** The site is public without a password, `robots.txt` admits crawlers
(except the two large offline files) and points at `sitemap.xml`, and the GitHub repository is public
so the About page's links resolve. Hostinger redeploys the `site` branch on each push.

## Rebuilding the data

The raw GIS pulls (about 60 MB) are not in the repository. They are listed with their service URLs
and SHA-256 hashes in `tools/src-2026-09-30/raw-manifest.json` and, for the 7 Oct 2026 ENC, NHD and
TIGER pulls, `tools/geometry/2026-10-07/raw-manifest.json`; the scripts that need them read
`raw/<date>/`. The geometry scripts need shapely and pyproj.

```bash
python3 tools/build-law.py                        # data/law.json: base registry plus the dated passes
python3 tools/patch-zones-local-2026-09-30.py     # zones-local.json: legal review text and law ids
python3 tools/patch-zones-local-2026-10-06.py     # zones-local.json: release text and kinds
python3 tools/patch-zones-local-2026-10-07.py     # zones-local.json: 7 Oct 2026 legal currency pass text
python3 tools/patch-zones-local-geometry-2026-10-07.py  # zones-local.json: NHD canals, TIGER and NAIP positions (run after the text patch)
python3 tools/extract-enc-2026-10-07.py           # tools/geometry/2026-10-07/enc-palmbeach.json from raw/2026-10-07/ (ENC pulls)
python3 tools/build-zones-palmbeach.py            # data/zones-palmbeach.json from the ENC extract ('osm' argument rebuilds the old file)
python3 tools/recompute-sites-ref-2026-10-07.py   # sites.json ref and edge against the rebuilt refuges
python3 tools/build-zones-statewide.py            # data/zones-statewide.json (needs raw/; applies the 7 Oct patch)
python3 tools/patch-zones-statewide-2026-10-07.py # without raw/: the same 7 Oct edits on the committed JSON
python3 tools/build-layers-2026.py                # ENC, seabed, contours, habitat, buoys, stations, spots, species (needs raw/)
python3 tools/patch-2026-10-07.py                 # regs.json, coverage.json, both species files: 7 Oct seasons and sweeps
python3 tools/patch-2026-10-07-drawn.py           # regs.json, coverage.json: Hollywood and inlet zones now drawn
python3 tools/check-text.py                       # no dashes, no permissive wording in the map's own text
python3 tools/test-data.py
NODE_PATH=<jsdom>/node_modules node test/smoke-test.js
python3 build-standalone.py [--out DIR]
```

- Never edit `data/law.json` by hand. Add a dated pass under `tools/law-updates/<date>/` or an entry
  in the manual block of `tools/law_updates.py`. Pass directories dated after 2026-10-06 are applied
  automatically, oldest first, in the file order of their `pass.json`; set the `version` in
  `tools/build-law.py` to the date of the latest currency check.
- `zones-local.json` cannot be rebuilt from `tools/build-zones-local.py`, because its August inputs
  were not kept. The two patch scripts change text, kinds and law ids only, never coordinates.
- `data/regs.json` and `data/coverage.json` are edited by hand, except for the dated scripted edits in
  `tools/patch-2026-10-07.py`, which assert the old text before replacing it and are safe to rerun.

## Endpoints and traps

The 30 September layers, with layer ids, counts, licences and traps, are documented in
`DATA-SOURCES.md` and `tools/src-2026-09-30/layers-research.json`. The August sources:

| Layer | Source |
|---|---|
| Municipal boundaries | `tigerweb.geo.census.gov/.../Places_CouSub_ConCity_SubMCD/MapServer/4`, filter `STATE='12'` |
| Navigation channels | `services7.arcgis.com/n1YM8pTrFmm7L4hs/.../National_Channel_Framework/FeatureServer/1`; the Intracoastal is named `IWW`, `GIWW` or `AIWW` |
| NPS park boundaries | `services1.arcgis.com/fBc8EJBxQRMcHlei/.../NPS_Land_Resources_Division_Boundary_and_Tract_Data_Service/FeatureServer/2`, filter on `UNIT_CODE` |
| FKNMS zones | `services2.arcgis.com/C8EMgrsFcRFL6LrL/.../FKNMS_Zone_Boundaries_With_Attributes_04282026/FeatureServer/1` |
| FWC Critical Wildlife Areas | `gis.myfwc.com/hosting/.../Critical_Wildlife_Areas_in_Florida/MapServer/7` |
| Florida state parks | `ca.dep.state.fl.us/arcgis/rest/services/OpenData/PARKS_BOUNDARIES/MapServer/0`; the `SUBMERGED` acreage decides whether a park has water |
| County boundaries | `gis.fdot.gov/arcgis/.../Admin_Boundaries/FeatureServer/5` |

Traps:
- NOAA Chart Display Service tiles are numbered two zoom levels below web-mercator; Leaflet needs
  `zoomOffset: -2`.
- Florida ENC has no 10 or 20 ft contours. US charts carry 12, 18, 30, 60, 100 and 120 ft lines.
- Fish havens are ENC obstructions (OBSTRN with CATOBS "fish haven"), not FSHFAC.
- ENC Direct returns bottom type (NATSUR) as text and does not expose RESTRN, so a charted
  restricted area does not say what is restricted.
- The same ENC feature appears once per usage band; deduplicate and keep the most detailed band.

Dead ends already checked: `mapservices.nps.gov/.../LandResourcesDivisionTractAndBoundaryService`
(404), `ocean.floridamarine.org/.../TRGIS_BaseLayers` (500), `atoll.floridamarine.org/.../OpenData_Boating`
(gone), `FKNMS_existingzones/FeatureServer/0` (needs a token), any statewide FDEP Class III-Marine
versus Class III-Fresh layer (does not exist), and `tileservice.charts.noaa.gov` (retired 2021).
