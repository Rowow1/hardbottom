# Data sources

Every file in `data/`, every remote map service the page loads, and the vendored code, with its
source, how it was derived, its size and its terms. Record counts were computed from the files on
6 October 2026. Licences for the project's own files are set out in `LICENSE-DATA.md`.

All agency data was pulled from the agencies' own public GIS services, mostly in August and
September 2026. Coordinates are `[lat, lon]` rounded to 5 decimal places (about 1 m). The raw pulls
are not in the repository because they total about 60 MB; `tools/src-2026-09-30/raw-manifest.json`
lists them with their service URLs, layer ids and SHA-256 hashes. The 7 October 2026 pulls (NOAA ENC
harbour band, USGS NHD, TIGERweb, NAIP readings) are in `raw/2026-10-07/`, listed the same way in
`tools/geometry/2026-10-07/raw-manifest.json`; the reduced public-domain geometry the builders read is
committed beside it.

The ENC restricted-area layer does not say what is restricted, because ENC Direct does not expose
the S-57 RESTRN attribute. The law comes from the CFR entries and the drawn zones.

## Open questions about sources

- **Aerial-imagery positions (settled 7 Oct 2026).** The John's Pass corridor in `ti58` and the Three
  Sisters circle in `3sis` had been read from Esri World Imagery. Both were re-read from USGS NAIP
  imagery (public domain). The corridor's north-west edge was moved onto the Madeira Beach shoreline,
  where the August outline left part of the pass out; its other vertices sit on the channel and were
  kept. The Three Sisters centre moved 264 m south, from the pond in the middle of the property to the
  spring pool. The `ti58` termini are now read on the TIGER/Line street at the Gulf and bay waterlines.
  Screenshots and the endpoints used are listed in `tools/geometry/2026-10-07/raw-manifest.json`.
- **NOAA chart coastline against the waterline.** On USGS NAIP imagery (service refreshed June 2024) the ENC coastline runs along the
  upper beach at Singer Island (26.83 N), about 15 to 30 m landward of the waterline, and at the
  waterline on north Palm Beach (26.76 N). The Palm Beach beach buffer is drawn at 150 yd and the
  refuge inner edge at 725 yd so that neither closure shrinks below the rule on that evidence.
- **Use constraints not located** for the FWRI Unified Reef Map v2.2, the West Florida Shelf benthic
  layer (Nova Southeastern University and FWRI) and the worm reef layer (TNC and FWRI).
- **August service URLs not kept** for the bridge inventory, the FWC pier inventory, the BOEM
  boundary, the FDEP parks pull and the FKNMS zones. Source names come from the build notes.
